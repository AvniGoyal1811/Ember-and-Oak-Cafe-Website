            <p class="one">At Ember & Oak, we strive to ensure our customers have a wonderful experience with each visit and every purchase. Our coffee and products are crafted with quality and care, and your satisfaction is essential to us. Below is our policy regarding refunds, exchanges, and replacements:</p>
            <h4 class="one">Refund Policy</h4>
            <p class="one">Due to the nature of our food and beverage products, refunds are limited to specific circumstances. Refunds are provided only under the following conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li id="point" class="two">Defective Product: If you receive an item that is damaged, defective, or not up to our quality standards, please notify us within 24 hours of purchase or receipt, along with proof of defect (a photo or description). We will verify the issue and issue a refund if the product is genuinely flawed.</li>
                <li id="point" class="two">Incorrect Order: If your order is incorrect (for example, wrong product delivered), contact us immediately. We’ll correct the order or issue a refund for any item we cannot replace.</li>
                <li id="point" class="two">Billing Error: If you were charged incorrectly, please bring this to our attention. If verified, a refund will be provided to correct any billing discrepancy.</li>
                <li id="point" class="two">Cancellations for Pre-Orders or Events: For catering, large orders, or special events, cancellations may be eligible for a partial refund if made within 24 hours before the event. Cancellations after this period may be subject to a cancellation fee.</li>
              </ul>
            <p class="one">Note: Refunds will be processed back to the original payment method, which may take 3-5 business days to reflect, depending on your bank or credit card provider.</p>
